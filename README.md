Bewerbung
=========
This contains a bunch of .odt template files that I made to apply to companies.
They are in German and very simplistic.

The font used is [Mukta](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mukta).
It needs to be installed for the templates to be displayed correctly.
For Linux that can for example be achieved by moving `.ttf` files extracted
from the download to the hidden `.fonts` folder in your home directory.

* [Anschreiben / cover note](Anschreiben.pdf)
* [Lebenslauf / CV](Lebenslauf.pdf)
* [Projektliste / list of projects](Projektliste.pdf)

The Profile picture of the 'Lebenslauf' is 696 x 946 pixels.
You can for example scale and trim your own picture using [the .svg template](src/Profilbild.svg) with
e.g. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
